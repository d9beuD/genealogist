# Alias: create-pr

This skill name is kept for compatibility.

## When to Use

- The user explicitly asks for `create-pr` or refers to the legacy skill name.
- You need to redirect pull request creation work to the canonical `sentry-skills:pr-writer` workflow.
- The task is specifically about writing or updating a pull request rather than general git operations.

Use `sentry-skills:pr-writer` as the canonical skill for creating and editing pull requests.

If invoked via `create-pr`, run the same workflow and conventions documented in `sentry-skills:pr-writer`.
